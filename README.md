# Basket-challenge-LSTM

This new repositary is about a data challenge predicting results of NBA games based on 11 features recorded every seconds of the two first quarters.
The 11 features are the following :
  - Score
  - Offensive rebound
  - Defensive rebound
  - Offensive foul
  - Defensive foul
  - Assist
  - Lost ball
  - Steals
  - Bad pass
  - Block
  - Miss
  
I will tackle this challenge by using deep learning algorithms to treat this multivariate time series challenge. For easier calculations, we will gather the data by 30 seconds and 1 minute timestep in order to capture significant moves.
